# Postaci Webmail
Postaci (Turkish for Postman) is multiplatform Webmail software which is database independent, multilanguage, POP3/IMAP, and fully MIME-compatible. While using POP3 mode to fetch messages it uses database fields to simulate IMAP folders, on which you can save, move, delete, and read e-mail. It also contains an addressbook, a notebook, and a bookmark manager application.

Version 3.0 will be a full overhaul with a beautiful new design.  Here is a sneak peek:
